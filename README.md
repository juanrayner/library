<h2>Semantic data access layer</h2>

QueryTalk is a <strong>semantic data access layer</strong> introducing human-readable instructions extremely easy to learn and use:

    s.City.WhichHas(d.Most, s.Company)

QueryTalk is also an <strong>ORM framework</strong> using the mapping data to facilitate data manipulation in your programming code. 

<h2>Code less, query with ease</h2>

<strong>QueryTalk is simple.</strong> There is no XML settings, no modelling, no contexts. 
<strong>QueryTalk is less code.</strong> In most cases, single instructions or even a single-line of code will do the job. 
<strong>QueryTalk is powerful.</strong> It offers plenty of options: semantic querying, SQL querying, a mix of both, and CRUD instructions.

<h2>Test immediately</h2>

Test your queries on the spot, exactly where they are created:

    s.Person.Whose(s.Person.Age, 40)
        .Test()
        .Go();

<h2>Map smarter</h2>

Use the mapper application (QueryTalker) to map your databases â€“ fast and efficiently. 
<strong>No interference</strong> between the mapping code and the programming code. 
The mapping files are stored as compiled .dll files in your QueryTalk repository.
